# **ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND DATA ANALYSIS PROJECTS**

## The Effects of Task Difficulty on EEG α Rhythm in Visual Spatial Attention	

Nov 2022 – Jun 2023

* Individually recruited over 30 subjects and conducted experiments to collected behavioral and EEG data.

* Computed the behavioral and α-related parameters of 22 subjects in MATLAB and examined the effects of task difficulty and laterality using t-test and ANOVA in SPSS.

* Proved previous findings that α modulation in visual spatial attention depends on subject’s α power level.

* Provided evidence for a possible non-linear relationship between task difficulty and α modulation.

## Biomechanical Study of Gait in CSM based on Wearable Technology	

Feb 2022 – Jul 2022

* Computed the gait parameters of 15 CSM patients and 32 healthy controls in MATLAB and selected the parameters with significant differences between the two groups using t-test.

* Conducted dimensionality reduction by excluding highly correlated parameters using correlation heatmap.

* Helped proposed a sorting method with 81% accuracy to distinguish CSM patients from healthy subjects by their gait features.

## Preliminary Study on the Neuroimages of Split-brain Patients	 

Apr 2021 – Oct 2021

* Analyzed fMRI and DTI data of split-brain patients using professional software and MATLAB.

* Evaluated brain connectivity changes in four patients undergoing callosotomy surgery using paired t-test.

* Identified possible relationships between their functional and structural brain connectivity changes.

Jul 2020

Huangpu District, Guangzhou, China

* Led a team of six to organized the survey during the COVID-19 pandemic.

* Conducted face-to-face interview with staff members at the Power Supply Bureau of Huangpu District.
